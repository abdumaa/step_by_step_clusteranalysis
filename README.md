# step_by_step_clusteranalysis
Here I use a step by step clusteranalysis on a credit card dataset.

The Idea behind this is to fully understand every step of a clusteranalysis trying to first avoid any given packages on python.
For this I will use the [creditcard-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata) on kaggle. 
This project is part of my presentation in the university subject "Multivariate Statistics".
